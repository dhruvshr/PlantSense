## Project Structure

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plantsense.git
cd plantsense
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations
```

5. Initialize the database:
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask development server:
```bash
python run.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

3. Upload a plant image through the interface

4. View the diagnosis and chat with PlantSense for detailed insights

## Model Training

The project uses a custom-trained ResNet18 model for plant disease detection. To train the model:

1. Download the Plant Village dataset
2. Run the training script:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

Training configurations can be modified in `src/training/trainer.py`.

## Development
