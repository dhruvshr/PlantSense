# PlantSense ðŸŒ¿

PlantSense is an AI-powered plant disease detection and diagnosis system that democratizes access to expert plant pathology knowledge. By combining computer vision and conversational AI, PlantSense provides:

1. Instant Disease Detection: Using advanced deep learning models trained on the Plant Village dataset, PlantSense can instantly identify 35+ common plant diseases from a single photo with over 92% accuracy.

2. Expert-Level Insights: Through integration with OpenAI's language models, PlantSense provides detailed, contextual information about:

    - Disease characteristics and progression
    - Environmental factors and conditions
    - Prevention strategies
    - Treatment recommendations
    - Long-term management practices

3. Interactive Guidance: Users can engage in natural conversation with the AI to:

    - Ask follow-up questions
    - Get clarification on treatments
    - Receive customized care instructions
    - Learn about prevention methods
